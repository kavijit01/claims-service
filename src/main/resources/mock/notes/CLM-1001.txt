3. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT
I am submitting this formal claim following a motor vehicle accident that occurred on the evening of May 10, 2024. I was traveling north on Washington St., maintaining the speed limit of 35 mph. As I entered the intersection with 6th Ave on a green light, a vehicle traveling west on 6th Ave failed to stop at a red light and struck my vehicle on the passenger side (T-bone collision).

The impact was significant, forcing my vehicle into a stationary light pole on the far corner of the intersection. Following the collision, the driver of the other vehicle admitted to being momentarily distracted by their mobile device. The local police department responded to the scene, and a formal report was filed (Case #XYZ-789). Both vehicles sustained severe damage and were subsequently towed from the site.

4. REASON FOR CLAIM
This claim is being filed to seek full coverage for the extensive property damage and medical expenses resulting from the aforementioned incident.

Property Damage: The front and side panels of my vehicle are heavily dented, the passenger-side windows are shattered, and the structural integrity of the frame appears compromised. Preliminary assessments from the authorized service center suggest the vehicle may be a total loss.

Medical Impact: As a direct result of the impact and the subsequent deployment of airbags, I sustained a concussion and severe whiplash. I was transported to the Emergency Room for immediate diagnostic testing and have been advised to undergo three weeks of physical therapy. These injuries have temporarily prevented me from returning to my job as an auto mechanic, resulting in lost wages.

5. CLAIM AMOUNT REQUESTED
Based on the estimates provided by licensed professionals and medical billing statements, the total amount sought for this claim is: $12,450.00.
